### Epesi CRM/ERP Developer

Epesi BIM (Business Information Manager) is a fully functional web CRM application to store, organize, access and share business records. It manages data precisely, flexibly and easily, simplifying internal communication and making work-flow more efficient. With sophisticated permission system and full record audit you will be in control of business critical information.

Epesi is a cross-platform web application running on top of LAMP stack and I am developing it since 2006.
It is fast and lightweight and very easy to use. It was translated by users to about 40 languages.

Epesi is open source released under MIT license.
